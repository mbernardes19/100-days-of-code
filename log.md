# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use spread operator on ES6 and also learned the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript.

**Thoughts:** At the beginning, spread operator seemed very hard to understand, but after some reading and testing, I got it. Also, I'm pretty happy for actually knowing the real relation between JavaScript and ECMAScript

**Link to work:** Not yet
