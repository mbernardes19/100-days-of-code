# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use spread operator on ES6 and also learned the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript.

**Thoughts:** At the beginning, spread operator seemed very hard to understand, but after some reading and testing, I got it. Also, I'm pretty happy for actually knowing the real relation between JavaScript and ECMAScript

**Link to work:** Not yet


### Day 2: November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned what is an anonymous function on JS and about imports and exports on ES6 and started my game for Github's GameOff base structure on ES6.

**Thoughts:** This one was harder and I've got plenty of bugs, but the game's structure it's finally getting clearer in my mind.

### Day 3: November 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Today I made a pull request to a open sourcer cause, fixed a navbar!

**Thoughts:** Happy for tackling an issue that I could fix all by myself.

### Day 4: November 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Today I have learned how to use Destructuring Assignment to assign variables from objects, nested objects and arrays! Also, review self-invoking functions.

**Thoughts:** Today I didn't have much time to tackle a project, but it is always good to learn something new from ES6.

### Day 5: November 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Today wasn't so productive cause I've been stucked trying to understand how Phaser 3 worked.

**Thoughts:** I don't know if I'll stick with Phaser 3 or 2 'cause 3 is giving me plenty of headaches.

**Link to work:** None, just some scrolling around Phaser 3's docs


### Day 6: November 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned what JSON is, MEAN stack, npm, about REST, Back-End Web Architecture and finally understood how Phaser is structured and made a full working template.

**Thoughts:** After a bad day, now I'm feeling really in great because I'm solving my problems and really understanding the "Development World"

**Link to work:** I had some troubles pushing the Phaser template to GitHub, tomorrow I'll do that


### Day 7: November 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got player's sprite and walk cycle frames inside Phaser Game, and I'm dealing with the framework much better. Also learned how to use TexturePacker with Phaser.

**Thoughts:** Still having some problems, but I feel that I'm much better than some days ago. Excited!

**Link to work:** None, still having troubles with git, I'll solve that soon.


### Day 8: November 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned how to use Rest Operator to reassing array elements and Destructed assignments to pass object as parameters

**Thoughts:** Feeling phisically tired today, but didn't give up!

**Link to work:** None
