# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use spread operator on ES6 and also learned the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript.

**Thoughts:** At the beginning, spread operator seemed very hard to understand, but after some reading and testing, I got it. Also, I'm pretty happy for actually knowing the real relation between JavaScript and ECMAScript

### Day 2: November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned what is an anonymous function on JS and about imports and exports on ES6 and started my game for Github's GameOff base structure on ES6.

**Thoughts:** This one was harder and I've got plenty of bugs, but the game's structure it's finally getting clearer in my mind.
